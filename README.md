## **Report**

  After having a few issues with my previous class (Bakery), I decided to just create another one from scratch. This project was made using the material provided in Moodle as well as zoom recorded classes.
  
  I started my application by initializing a Node project in the Visual Studio Code, and including my name and git links during this process. I also installed express to be able to use routes, mongoose to use MongoDB, body-parser to be able to use multiples http requests and nodemon.
  
  I also created a new cluster in my MongoDB Atlas as my old one was named Cluster0. The username and password were changed for my student id number.
